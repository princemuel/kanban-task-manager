# Kanban Task Manager (In Progress)

The Kanban board is an easy-to-use agile project management tool using the Kanban methodology that helps you to visualize and manage workflows. It can be physical or digital and features columns representing stages of a process. Cards are used to track individual tasks and activities as they progress through the stages in a production pipeline. Tasks are arranged in columns according to their current status such as 'todo', 'doing' and 'done'. Columns can be added and named to be more specific to the needs of the team. The board allows the team to track potential bottlenecks in the pipeline if too many tasks end up sitting in one column. It also allows the team to estimate lead times for tasks in the pipeline.
